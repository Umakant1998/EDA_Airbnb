In the project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the famous city in the world but also has top global destination for visitors attracted to its museums, entertainment, restaurants, UN offices and commerce.

The project began with a comprehensive understanding of the Airbnb dataset, including data size, information like properties and their availability, price, location, reviews and ratings, exploring data related to Airbnb listings, including the number of properties listed, host characteristics, the variety of amenities available, and the occupancy rate of different properties etc. Further analysis of data to understand the significance of the reviews left by Airbnb users.

Exploratory data analysis projects on Airbnb typically involve investigating patterns and trends in various aspects of the platform, such as pricing, popularity and availability of listings. This data can be used to gain insights into consumer behavior and preferences, as well as to inform marketing and business strategies for hosts and Airbnb as a company. Techniques such as data visualization and objective solution may be used to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions.

In this type of analysis, data visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts are used to help identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. For instance, a bar chart can be used to show the distribution of properties across different neighbourhoods in a city.

Overall, the exploratory data analysis provides crucial insights for the Airbnb platform to improve customer satisfaction and enhance rental revenues. The insights also benefitted renters who can use the data generated to gain a deeper understanding of the landscape and make informed decisions.
